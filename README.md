# Uber-NYC-Data-Analysis

This notebook contains a basic analysis through some visualizations of the Uber Pickups in New York City data set.

The analysis is broken up into 3 sections:
- Data Loading and Preparation.
- Exploration and visualization of pickups from April to September 2014.
- Conclusion.

## 1. Data Loading and Preparation
In this section, we load the necessary modules, load the data, and prepare it for analysis.

## 2 Exploration and Visualization
In this section, we explore and visualize the data by analyzing the number of trips by hour, month, and weekday.

### 2.1 Trips by hour
We group the data by hour and create a sub-dataframe to analyze the number of trips by hour. We then plot the results and analyze the peak hours of Uber pickups.

### 2.2 Trips by month
We group the data by month and create a sub-dataframe to analyze the number of trips by month. We then plot the results and analyze the growth rate of Uber pickups from April to September 2014.

### 2.3 Trips by weekday
We group the data by weekday and create a sub-dataframe to analyze the number of trips by weekday. We then plot the results and analyze the minimum number of trips by weekday.

## Conclusion
From our analysis, we can conclude that the majority of Uber's clients are workers, with the highest number of trips around 16:00 and 18:00. We also observed that from April to September 2014, Uber was in a continuous improvement process, as the number of trips increased each month. Finally, we saw that the minimum number of trips occurred on Sundays.
